# Aries_Hub 

## Description
This challenge was designed to allow the developer code a password generator while validating the password using Javasript. 

This was aimed at helping me understand how to generate passwords as well as validating the password using the acceptance criteria provided; while developing the skills of independent research' logical thinking and  problem solving.

In the course of this challenge i learnt the use of different array methods and properties such as `.join`; `length`. I also learnt how to use some JavaScript global methods and properties such as `parseInt` and `NaN`. This challenge helped me understand the concept of passwor valiation and the use of the `While` statement.

Although this challenge was a bit though as i had to do lots of research on my own; I was able to carefully arrange the codes leaving comments where possible to make it understable and easy for it to be modified by anyone.

## Application
